                My name is Spencer Fife. I am formerly a baker in trade, but now
                have decided to apply myself to the coding and programming
                field. I was born in Seattle and have lived there my entire
                life, so far. While growing up, it was hard to ignore the tech
                and internet boom and now the field seems to still be
                competitive and ever growing. It seems natural to get caught up
                in the zeitgeist of the programming industry, as it is embedded
                in our daily lives and I want to be a part of it.
              </p>

              <p>
                This is my first dabbling with coding and by the end of this
                coding bootcamp, I want it to represent what I've learned and
                how I apply that knowledge. It may be rough right now, but it is
                miles ahead of what I could do when I signed up for this class.
              </p>
